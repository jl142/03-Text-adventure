Peer's repository: https://github.com/jl142/03-Text-adventure.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?



It is very hard to find one wrong character in a giant sea of characters.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 


He had a good story telling element that would be good to flesh out in my project.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 

Make sure that the code is consistant with all of the values all the way through. Small discrepencies make it difficult to read and may not work.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

The different pathway that you take and the different verbs used.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
The fact that it didn't run when I clicked it was very confusing.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?



yes it does.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 

Talk more about the story of what you want your project todo. With the code not working I would like a more written out story.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.



It looks very nice but I have no clue how good it is since it wont run.
